# Global Climate Monitor

## Project Overview  
Global Climate Monitor is an innovative system that integrates classical meteorological data with advanced quantum computing and state-of-the-art AI models. Our goal is to detect and analyze complex, abnormal, and high-risk weather phenomena worldwide with unprecedented accuracy and speed.

## Unique Approach  
Unlike current climate monitoring systems that focus on isolated or linear events, our project leverages a hybrid classical-quantum architecture combined with deep AI preprocessing. This approach enables us to capture nonlinear interactions among atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial variables, detecting compound climate events that are difficult to identify using existing technologies.

## Monitoring Diverse Meteorological Phenomena  
We aim to monitor multiple natural phenomena, each characterized by specific environmental indicators, including but not limited to:

1. **Flooding and Inundation**  
   - Precipitation rates and accumulation (mm/h, mm/day)  
   - River levels and flow rates (m, m³/s)  
   - Surface runoff indices and soil infiltration capacity  
   - Atmospheric pressure changes and humidity levels

2. **Drought**  
   - Temperature anomalies and extremes (°C)  
   - Vegetation stress indices (NDVI, NDWI)  
   - Soil moisture and infiltration  
   - Low precipitation and relative humidity

3. **Storms and Severe Weather**  
   - Atmospheric instability indices (CAPE)  
   - Wind shear and radar reflectivity (DBZ)  
   - Rapid pressure drops and wind velocities  
   - Sea surface temperatures and cyclone energy metrics

4. **Wildfire Risk**  
   - Fire risk indices (Nesterov)  
   - Vegetation dryness and temperature anomalies  
   - Wind speed and direction  
   - Soil moisture and precipitation deficits

5. **Heatwaves**  
   - Persistent temperature extremes and anomalies  
   - Heat index and humidity levels  
   - Duration of thermal stress periods

6. **Coastal Flooding and High Tides**  
   - Tide variations and sea surface temperatures  
   - Atmospheric pressure and storm surge indicators  
   - Wind speed and direction affecting coastal water levels

## Expected Impact  
- Enhanced early warning systems to improve disaster preparedness and reduce human and economic losses.  
- Scientific advancement by pioneering the fusion of AI and quantum computing in climate science.  
- Valuable support for governments and agencies in making informed, timely decisions for climate resilience.

## Why Partner with IBM?  
IBM is a global leader in quantum computing and AI technologies. Access to IBM Quantum processors and cloud infrastructure will enable us to develop and deploy scalable quantum algorithms critical to the success of this project. This partnership will accelerate innovation and drive meaningful progress in global climate risk monitoring.
